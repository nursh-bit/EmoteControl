## 🎲 Advanced Conditions

### Random Chance
```lua
conditions = {
  randomChance = 0.5  -- 50% chance to trigger
}
```

### Combat State
```lua
conditions = {
  inCombat = true  -- Only trigger in combat
}
```

### Group Requirements
```lua
conditions = {
  inGroup = true,  -- Must be in a group
  groupSize = { min = 5, max = 40 }  -- Raid-sized groups only
}
```

### Buff/Aura Checks
```lua
conditions = {
  hasAura = "Bloodlust"  -- Only trigger when you have this buff
}
```

### Boss Targeting
```lua
conditions = {
  targetIsBoss = true  -- Only trigger on boss enemies
}
```

### Health Thresholds
```lua
conditions = {
  healthBelow = 30  -- Only when below 30% health
}
```

### Complete Example
```lua
{
  id = "low_health_warning",
  event = "PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED",
  cooldown = 60,
  conditions = {
    healthBelow = 20,
    inGroup = true,
    randomChance = 0.5
  },
  messages = {
    "Getting low on health at <health%>%!",
    "Need heals! Down to <health%>%!",
  }
}
```

## 📦 Import/Export System

### Exporting Your Configuration

1. Type `/sl export` to open the Import/Export UI
2. Click **"Generate Export"**
3. Copy the generated string (starts with `SL1:`)
4. Share with friends or save as backup

### Importing Configurations

1. Type `/sl import`
2. Paste the import string into the text box
3. Choose:
   - **Import (Replace)**: Replaces all your current overrides
   - **Import (Merge)**: Adds new triggers without removing existing ones
4. Click the button

### Use Cases
- **Share** funny trigger packs with guildmates
- **Backup** your custom configurations

## 💬 Conditional Message Variants

Messages can now change based on your group state!

### Basic Example
```lua
messages = {
  solo = {"Fighting alone, as usual."},
  party = {"Let's do this, team!"},
  raid = {"25 people and I still pulled aggro."},
  instance = {"Dungeon mode activated!"}
}
```

### How It Works
- **solo**: Used when not in a group
- **party**: Used in 5-man groups
- **raid**: Used in raid groups
- **instance**: Used when in an instance/dungeon

### Locale Variants
Messages can also be localized by client locale:

```lua
messages = {
  enUS = {"Ready check!"},
  frFR = {"Vérification prête !"},
  default = {"Ready!"}
}
```

### Fallback Behavior
If you don't specify all variants, the addon will:
1. Try to use the appropriate variant for your situation
2. Fall back to any available variant
3. Use standard message list if no variants match

### Advanced Example
```lua
{
  id = "death_announcement",
  event = "PLAYER_DEAD",
  cooldown = 0,
  messages = {
    solo = {
      "I have made a tactical error.",
      "Death is just a setback.",
    },
    party = {
      "Sorry team, I died.",
      "Rezzing in a moment...",
    },
    raid = {
      "Down. Healer shortage?",
      "Floor tank reporting for duty.",
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎓 Spec-Specific Packs

### What Are They?
Packs that only trigger for specific specializations, allowing for highly targeted announcements.

### Example: Fire Mage
- Only triggers when you're in Fire spec
- Announces Combustion, Pyroblast, Phoenix Flames, etc.
- Spec-specific flavor and personality

### Example: Protection Paladin
- Tank-specific announcements
- Defensive cooldown tracking
- Low health warnings for healers
- Group-aware messages

### Creating Your Own
```lua
Emote Control:RegisterPack({
  id = "myspec",
  name = "My Spec Pack",
  defaults = { 
    class = "MAGE",
    specID = 63  -- Fire Mage
  },
  triggers = {
    -- Your spec-specific triggers here
  }
})
```

### Spec IDs
Find spec IDs using:
```lua
/run local id = GetSpecializationInfo(GetSpecialization()); print(id)
```

## 📝 Tips & Tricks

### Adaptive Cooldowns (Anti-spam)
When enabled, cooldowns scale up automatically as you approach the per-minute cap. Set the max multiplier to control how much cooldowns can stretch during heavy chat.

### Spec-Based Pack Profiles
Enable different pack selections per specialization. Turn on in settings or via `/sl packprofile on`, then toggle packs while in each spec.

### Combining Conditions
```lua
conditions = {
  class = "WARRIOR",
  specID = 73,  -- Arms
  inCombat = true,
  healthAbove = 50,
  randomChance = 0.3
}
```

### Using Pick and RNG
```lua
messages = {
  "Dealt <rng:1000-9999> damage! (probably)",
  "<pick:Fire|Ice|Arcane> magic is the best!",
}
```

### Context-Aware Messages
```lua
messages = {
  party = {
    "<player> used <spell> on <target>!",
  },
  solo = {
    "Cast <spell>. <target> didn't stand a chance.",
  }
}
```
